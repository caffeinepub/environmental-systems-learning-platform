# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Add clickable hyperlinks to all interactive activities across unit pages to improve navigation and accessibility.

**Planned changes:**
- Convert interactive activity headings (BioticAbioticSorting, FoodWebBuilder, VirtualLab, BiogeochemicalCycles) in Unit1EnvironmentalSystems.tsx into clickable links that scroll to their sections
- Add a table of contents navigation section at the top of Unit1EnvironmentalSystems.tsx listing all interactive activities with anchor links
- Apply the same hyperlink and navigation pattern to all unit pages (Unit2NatureOfScience.tsx through Unit9Legislation.tsx)
- Implement smooth scroll behavior for all activity links
- Style all navigation elements consistently with the nature-inspired design system

**User-visible outcome:** Users can click on interactive activity links in a navigation section or on activity headings to smoothly scroll to and access specific activities within each unit page.
